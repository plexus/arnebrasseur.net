## 2015

{:#rugb-lisp}
### Rug-B: Growing a LISP

_04-06-2015, Berlin, Germany_

The idea for this talk had been floating in my mind for a little
while, and when another speaker canceled it seemed the perfect
opportunity to try it out.

In the spirit of Guy Steele's
[Growing a Language](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ahvzDzKdB0), I
"grow" a LISP by step by step defining concepts, starting from the
absolute basics. The talk has a bit of a performance vibe to it, with
minimal slides and a particular rhythm. Something I might push a bit
more in future versions :)

Of the different versions of this talk this one is the most theoretical.
