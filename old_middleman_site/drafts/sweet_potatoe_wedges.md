# Oven-baked Sweet Potato Wedges

## Literally the Ultimate Party Snack

It has taken weeks, nay, months of diligent research and experimentation, but
today we can tell you: we cracked the code. Behold the ultimate party snack.

Make no mistake, what we're about to reveal in these paragraphs is not for the
faint of heart. Those inexperienced in the art of chilli-garlic binging might
want to sit this one out. For the rest of you (you know who you are) follow
these instructions to the letter!

Nowadays I won't show up at a party without a batch of these bad boys. They are
delicious, packed with intense flavour, and 100% guilt-free. Instead of greasy
processed party snacks you get little packets of nutrients and digestible
fibers. What's not to love?

Ingredients

* One sweet potato, not too small. The type that is brown on the outside and orange on the inside
* Two red chilis (or more). I'm using dried here but you can go for fresh just as well.
* Two cloves of garlic (or more)
* Black pepper, coarsly ground
* Sea salt
* 1/2 tbsp olive oil
* Oregano, dried

Preheat the oven to 200 celcius. . Cut the sweet potato lengthwise into three
slices, each as thick as your thumb. Now cut each slice into wedges. Tilt your
knife left, then right, to get that wedgey triangular shape. Toss the wedges in
a bowl.

Take a few dried chilis and as some cloves of garlic. Start with two each if
this is the first time you make this recipe, then work your way up from there.
Roughly chop them up and toss in a mortar. Add coarsly ground black pepper and a
dash of sea salt, then mash and grind it all together until you have a smooth
garlic and chili puree. Nice!

Scrape the mix out of the mortar and onto the wedges. Add a drop of olive oil,
then with a spoon mix it all up until the sweet potatoes are nicely covered.

Put a sheet of baking paper on a baking tray and spread the wedges out evenly on
top. Ideally none of them are touching each other. Sprinkle with oregano, set a
timer for twelve minutes, and put the tray in the preheated oven near the top.

As soon as the twelve minutes are up, switch the oven to grill. Leave another
two or three minutes so the outside of the wedges is just starting to
caramelize. Take it out, and let it cool or eat them straight away. I know, it's
hard to resist.
