## Squint rabbit hole

I'm noticing that I'm less and less bought into the ClojureScript/React/Reagent
style of frontend building. We've done a lot of these over the years, and it
does provide a pretty elegant workflow, but you need complicated heavy tooling,
to build big heavy blobs of JS. On top of that React is increasingly considered
legacy technology, and the web platform itself has evolved significantly since
React and Reagent came out.

Compass was my first opportunity to use [HTMX](https://htmx.org/). It goes back
to the roots of hypermedia (a la Fielding), enriching standard markup so you get
more ways for HTML elements to participate in HTTP interactions
