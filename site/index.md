Hello!

Arne is a Belgian software developer and technical leader, public speaker,
author, and digital creative.

I founded and run the [Gaiwan](https://gaiwan.co) consultancy.

I created a large number of popular libraries, in particular for Clojure, under the [lambdaisland](https://github.com/lambdaisland) monniker, including the de facto test runner for Clojure, Kaocha.

In the past I created a number of condensed tutorial videos for the Clojure ecosystem, these are now free to watch at [LambdaIsland.com](https://lambdaisland.com).

You can find other videos of mine on the [Lambda Island Youtube channel](https://youtube.com/lambdaisland), or on the [Makertube Peertube instance](https://makertube.net/c/squid.casa/videos).

You can find some of my technical writing on the [Lambda Island
blog](https://lambdaisland.com/blog/), the [Gaiwan
blog](https://gaiwan.co/blog/), and Gaiwan's wiki-slash-pattern-repository [Tea
Garden](https://gaiwan.co/wiki/Home).

You can find me on federated social media as [@plexus@toot.cat](https://toot.cat/@plexus).

You can find what I'm reading on the [Bookrastinating Bookwyrm instance](https://bookrastinating.com/user/plexus).

I occasionally post pictures on [PixelFed](https://pixelfed.social/plexus).

I am one of the main organizers of the [Heart of Clojure](https://heartofclojure.eu) conference, which took place in 2019 and 2024.

I help maintain the [Overtone](https://overtone.github.io/) live music coding environment for Clojure.
